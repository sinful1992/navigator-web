/**
 * PHASE 1.1.2 FIX: Sequence Corruption Detection Threshold
 *
 * Maximum allowed gap between local max sequence and cloud max sequence
 * Before marking cloud as corrupted.
 *
 * Rationale:
 * - Legitimate gaps occur when multiple devices create operations
 * - A 5-device setup with 2000 ops each = 10,000 gap
 * - Only flag as corrupted if gap is UNREASONABLY large (>10k)
 * - Also requires localMaxSeq > 100 (don't flag brand new devices)
 *
 * History:
 * - v1: 1000 (too aggressive, caused false positives)
 * - v2: 10000 (current, allows legitimate multi-device gaps)
 * - v3: Could use adaptive threshold based on operation count
 *
 * Impact if changed:
 * - Too low: False positives, skip legitimate syncs
 * - Too high: Miss actual corruption, poison sequence generator
 *
 * Recommendation: Only increase if you have 10+ devices actively syncing

/**
 * PHASE 1: Multi-Device Protection Window
 *
 * How long to prevent sync after completing an address (milliseconds).
 * Prevents duplicate completion race condition between devices.
 *
 * Scenario:
 * - Device A completes address, sets protection flag
 * - Device B completes same address shortly after
 * - If protection expires before sync, Device B doesn't see Device A's completion
 * - Results in duplicate completion record
 *
 * Current value: 30000ms (30 seconds)
 * Phase 1.2: Plan to increase to 120000ms (2 minutes) or use vector clocks
 *
 * Trade-off:
 * - Higher = safer but blocks syncing longer
 * - Lower = riskier but faster response
 *
 * Real-world: Most completions 1-2 seconds apart, so 30s is safe
 * High-throughput: If completing 1 address/sec, need to increase

 * - Cloud retention is separate (handled by server)

 * Current: true (enabled by default, critical for data integrity)
 * Impact: Negligible performance cost (<1ms per 1000 ops)
 * Benefits: Catches data loss immediately, enables early debugging
 *
 * Rationale:
 * - Gaps in sequence numbers indicate operations were lost or not synced
 * - Could be from network issues, device crashes, or sync bugs
 * - Better to detect and log than silently lose data
 * - Performance impact is negligible (just a sort + linear scan)
