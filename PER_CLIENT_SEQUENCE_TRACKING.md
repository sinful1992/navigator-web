# üîß PER-CLIENT SEQUENCE TRACKING - Phase 1.1.3

**Task:** Phase 1.1.3 - Add per-client sequence tracking
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Duration:** ~1.5 hours
**Risk Level:** Low (Diagnostic Enhancement)

---

## OVERVIEW

Implemented per-client sequence tracking to detect out-of-order operations and identify which device has sync issues.

### What This Fixes:
- ‚ùå **BEFORE:** No way to detect which device sends operations out-of-order
- ‚ùå **BEFORE:** Out-of-order operations silently merged
- ‚ùå **BEFORE:** Difficult to diagnose multi-device sync problems
- ‚úÖ **AFTER:** Track highest sequence per client
- ‚úÖ **AFTER:** Warn when operations arrive out-of-order
- ‚úÖ **AFTER:** Identify problematic devices for support

---

## THE PROBLEM

### Out-of-Order Operations

In a multi-device sync system, operations can arrive out-of-order if:

1. **Network Delays:** Device sends operations slowly
2. **Device Offline:** Device comes online, sends old operations
3. **Client Bugs:** Client sequence generator gets out of sync
4. **Race Conditions:** Multiple tabs on same device send operations

### Example Scenario:

**Device A with bug in sequence generator:**
```
Time T1: Device A creates operation, assigns sequence 100
Time T2: Device A creates operation, assigns sequence 101 (but actually 50!)
Time T3: Cloud receives seq 100, then seq 50 (out-of-order!)
```

**Without tracking:** We don't know Device A has the problem
**With tracking:** We log "Device A sent seq 50 after seq 100"

---

## THE SOLUTION

### Per-Client Sequence Map

Track the highest sequence number seen from each client:

```typescript
private clientSequences: Map<string, number> = new Map();

// Example state:
{
  "device-1": 500,      // Highest seq from device 1 is 500
  "device-2": 1200,     // Highest seq from device 2 is 1200
  "device-3": 300,      // Highest seq from device 3 is 300
}
```

### Detection Algorithm

When receiving operation from Device X with sequence N:
```typescript
if (N <= currentMax[X]) {
  // OUT OF ORDER! Log warning
  log("Out-of-order: Device X sent seq " + N + " after " + currentMax[X]);
}
```

### Example Detection:

```
Device A (seq 500) sends operations:
‚îú‚îÄ Seq 501 ‚úÖ (501 > 500, normal)
‚îú‚îÄ Seq 502 ‚úÖ (502 > 501, normal)
‚îú‚îÄ Seq 450 ‚ùå (450 < 502, OUT-OF-ORDER!)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Warning logged: "Out-of-order operation detected"
‚îî‚îÄ Seq 503 ‚úÖ (503 > 502, normal again)
```

---

## IMPLEMENTATION

### New Instance Variable

```typescript
private clientSequences: Map<string, number> = new Map();
```

Tracks maximum sequence seen from each client.

### New Methods

**1. `rebuildClientSequences()` (Private)**
```typescript
private rebuildClientSequences(): void {
  // Called on load to reconstruct the map from existing operations
  // Iterates through all operations, tracks max per client
  // Logs debug info showing unique clients
}
```

**2. `detectOutOfOrderOperation()` (Private)**
```typescript
private detectOutOfOrderOperation(operation: Operation): {
  isOutOfOrder: boolean;
  previousMax?: number;
}
// Returns whether operation is out-of-order
// Logs warning if detected
```

**3. `updateClientSequence()` (Private)**
```typescript
private updateClientSequence(operation: Operation): void {
  // Updates the max sequence for this client
  // Called for each operation processed
}
```

**4. `getClientSequenceStats()` (Public)**
```typescript
public getClientSequenceStats(): Record<string, number> {
  // Returns per-client statistics
  // Used for diagnostics and debugging
  // Example: { "device-1": 500, "device-2": 1200 }
}
```

### Integration Points

**Load Time:**
```typescript
// In load() method
this.rebuildClientSequences();
logger.info('Loaded operation log:', {
  uniqueClients: this.clientSequences.size,  // NEW
  // ...
});
```

**Merge Time:**
```typescript
// In mergeRemoteOperations(), for each operation:
const outOfOrderInfo = this.detectOutOfOrderOperation(remoteOp);
this.updateClientSequence(remoteOp);
```

---

## OUTPUT EXAMPLES

### Normal Operation (No Issues):

```
Loaded operation log: {
  operationCount: 150,
  uniqueClients: 3,
  lastSequence: 500,
  lastSyncSequence: 500,
  clients: [
    { clientId: "device-1", maxSequence: 200 },
    { clientId: "device-2", maxSequence: 150 },
    { clientId: "device-3", maxSequence: 150 }
  ]
}
```

### Out-of-Order Detected:

```
üîß OUT-OF-ORDER OPERATION detected: {
  clientId: "device-1",          // Which device sent it
  operationSequence: 450,         // The sequence number
  previousMax: 500,               // What we've seen before
  gap: 50                         // How far back it went
}

// Log shows Device 1 sent seq 450 after we saw seq 500
// Indicates Device 1 has sequence generator bug or other sync issue
```

### Client Sequence Stats:

```typescript
const stats = manager.getClientSequenceStats();
// Returns:
{
  "device-1": 500,
  "device-2": 1200,
  "device-3": 300,
  "cloud-server": 5000
}
```

## DIAGNOSTICS

### Interpreting Client Sequence Stats

**Normal Pattern:**
```typescript
{
  "device-1": 500,
  "device-2": 450,
  "device-3": 480
}
// All devices have reasonable sequences
// All working properly
```

**Problem Pattern 1 - Stalled Device:**
```typescript
{
  "device-1": 5000,
  "device-2": 5000,
  "device-3": 100      // <- WAY TOO LOW
}
// Device 3 hasn't synced in a long time
// Or is offline/stuck
```

**Problem Pattern 2 - Poisoned Sequence:**
```typescript
{
  "device-1": 500,
  "device-2": 1000000  // <- WAY TOO HIGH
}
// Device 2's sequence generator got corrupted
// Likely from prior bug or cloud contamination
```

**Problem Pattern 3 - Duplicate Device:**
```typescript
{
  "device-1": 500,
  "device-1": 600      // Two entries with same ID?
}
// Usually means ID collision or reset
// Should not happen in normal operation
```

---

## TESTING

### Manual Test: Normal Merge

**Input:** 3 operations from Device B
```typescript
const ops = [
  { clientId: 'device-b', sequence: 1, ... },
  { clientId: 'device-b', sequence: 2, ... },
  { clientId: 'device-b', sequence: 3, ... },
];
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ Merged successfully
clientSequences['device-b'] = 3
No out-of-order warnings
```

### Manual Test: Out-of-Order Merge

**Input:** Operations arrive out-of-order from Device A
```typescript
const ops = [
  { clientId: 'device-a', sequence: 100, ... },
  { clientId: 'device-a', sequence: 50, ... },  // OUT OF ORDER
  { clientId: 'device-a', sequence: 101, ... },
];
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üîß OUT-OF-ORDER OPERATION detected: {
  clientId: "device-a",
  operationSequence: 50,
  previousMax: 100,
  gap: 50
}
// Still merges the operations (doesn't block)
// But logs the warning for debugging
```

### Automated Tests (Future)

Will add in Phase 3:
```typescript
test('should detect out-of-order operations', async () => {
  // Create operations with reversed sequences
  // Verify warning is logged
  // Verify clientSequenceStats shows correct max
});

test('should rebuild client sequences on load', async () => {
  // Save operations to storage
  // Create new manager instance
  // Verify clientSequences rebuilt correctly
});

test('should handle operations from many devices', async () => {
  // Create 20 operations from 10 different devices
  // Verify each device tracked independently
  // Verify getClientSequenceStats returns all 10
});
```

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### Current Implementation:
1. **Detection Only:** Warns but doesn't fix out-of-order operations
2. **No Reordering:** Operations still applied in merge order
3. **Client Reset:** If client ID changes, loses history
4. **Memory:** Keeps stats forever (compacted with operations)

### Future Improvements (Phase 2+):
1. **Auto-Reordering:** Sort operations per client before merge
2. **Correction:** Send warning back to client to resync
3. **Persistence:** Save client sequence stats separately
4. **Cleanup:** Forget old devices after threshold time

---

## REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Multi-Tab Sync

**Setup:** User has 2 tabs of same app open
**Problem:** Tab 1 and Tab 2 both create operations, get mixed sequence numbers

**With Tracking:**
```
Device seen doing this:
- Tab 1: "browser-device-1"
- Tab 2: "browser-device-1"  (same ID!)

But operations arrive in wrong order:
"browser-device-1" sent seq 100, then seq 50 (out of order!)
```

**Diagnosis:** Same device ID used twice, need better device ID generation

### Scenario 2: Mobile App Offline

**Setup:** Mobile user works offline for 2 days, then comes online
**Problem:** Mobile operations synced last, but have old sequence numbers

**With Tracking:**
```
clientSequences shows:
- "mobile-user": 100 (last sync was 2 days ago)
- "desktop-user": 5000 (actively syncing)

OUT-OF-ORDER operations from "mobile-user" because it was offline
```

**Diagnosis:** Normal behavior, mobile was offline, nothing to fix

### Scenario 3: Network Reordering

**Setup:** Slow network connection (satellite, flaky WiFi)
**Problem:** Operations sent in order, arrive out-of-order due to network

**With Tracking:**
```
Logged warnings:
- Device-A sent seq 150 after seq 200
- Device-A sent seq 149 after seq 150

Pattern shows network reordering, not device bug
```

**Diagnosis:** Network issue, will resolve when connection stabilizes
