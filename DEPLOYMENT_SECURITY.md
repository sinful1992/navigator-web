# Secure Deployment Strategy

## Current Setup
Your GitHub Actions workflow has been configured to deploy only the compiled build (`dist/`) to GitHub Pages, not your source code.

## Security Options

### Option 1: Private Main Repo + Public Deploy Repo (Recommended)
1. **Make this repo private** on GitHub
2. Create a separate public repo for deployment only (e.g., `navigator-web-pages`)
3. Modify the workflow to push built assets to the public repo

### Option 2: Deploy Branch Strategy (Current Setup)
- Your current workflow deploys only the `dist/` folder to GitHub Pages
- Source code remains in the main branch but repo must be public for GitHub Pages (free tier)
- Built assets are minified/obfuscated, making reverse engineering harder

### Option 3: Enhanced Build Obfuscation
Add JavaScript obfuscation to your build process:

```bash
npm install --save-dev javascript-obfuscator
```

Then modify your build process to obfuscate the output.

## Repository Security Checklist

- [ ] Add restrictive license file
- [ ] Configure GitHub repository settings:
  - [ ] Disable wiki
  - [ ] Disable issues (if not needed)
  - [ ] Restrict who can see commits
- [ ] Set up GitHub repository secrets:
  - [ ] `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
  - [ ] `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - [ ] `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
  - [ ] `VITE_DEMO_EMAIL` (optional)
  - [ ] `VITE_DEMO_PASSWORD` (optional)

## Brand Protection
Consider registering your app name and logo as trademarks to prevent others from using your branding even if they copy the code.

## Current Workflow Security Features
- Only deploys compiled `dist/` folder
- Environment variables injected at build time (not stored in repo)
- No source code in deployment artifacts
- Minified JavaScript bundles
